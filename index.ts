// Type Inferences

// TypeScript expects the data type of the variable to match the type of the value initially assigned to it at declaration.
// TypeScript recognizes JavaScript’s built-in “primitive” data types:  
  // boolean
  // number
  // null
  // string
  // undefined

  let aged = true;
  let realAge = 0; //the type is number, so it has to be number
  
  if (aged) {
    realAge = 5;
  }
  
  let dogAge = realAge * 7;
  
  console.log(`${dogAge} years`);

  // Type Shapes //

// An object’s shape describes, among other things, what properties and methods it does or doesn’t contain.
let firstName = 'gagan!';

console.log(firstName.toUpperCase());

console.log(firstName.length);

/// Type Any //

// Variables of type any can be assigned to any value and TypeScript won’t give an error if they’re reassigned to a different type later on.

let guess; // TypeScript considers it to be of type any

guess = 'guess who'
guess = 2;

// Variable Type Annotations //

// Variables can have type annotations (also known as type declarations) added just after their names. 
// Provide a type annotation by appending a variable with a colon (:) and the type (e.g., number, string, or any).

let phoneNumber : string;

if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
